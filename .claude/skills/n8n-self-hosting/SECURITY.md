# Secrets & hardening

The deploy flow lives in `SKILL.md`; this file is the security depth it points to.

## Generating secrets (on the target box)

Generate each value **on the server** and **write it into `.env`, replacing the matching
`REPLACE_WITH_…` placeholder** — generating without substituting leaves the literal placeholder
as the password, and Postgres/n8n then fail to connect. Never reuse values across instances.

```bash
cd <DATA_FOLDER>

# Encryption key — encrypts all stored credentials. REQUIRED, both modes.
openssl rand -base64 32

# Queue mode also needs two Postgres passwords:
openssl rand -base64 24   # POSTGRES_PASSWORD (superuser)
openssl rand -base64 24   # POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_PASSWORD (the user n8n connects as)
```

Substitute each into `.env` (edit it directly, or for a fresh `.env` with no special chars in
the value, e.g.):

```bash
KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
# write it in place of the placeholder (use a delimiter that won't clash with base64's / and +)
sed -i "s|^N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=.*|N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=${KEY}|" .env
# repeat for POSTGRES_PASSWORD / POSTGRES_NON_ROOT_PASSWORD in queue mode
```

Then **confirm nothing was missed** and lock the file down:

```bash
grep REPLACE_WITH_ .env   # must print NOTHING before you launch
chmod 600 .env
```

## The encryption key (`N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY`) — read this twice

- It encrypts every credential n8n stores. **Lose it or change it and all saved credentials
  become undecryptable** — effectively a reset.
- **Set it explicitly before the first start.** If you start n8n once without it, n8n
  auto-generates one into the `n8n_data` volume (`~/.n8n/config`); adding a *different* key
  later breaks decryption. The templates set it from `.env`, so do step 4 before step 6.
- **Queue mode: the exact same key must reach the main process and every worker.** The
  `x-n8n` anchor in the queue compose guarantees this — don't override it per-service.
- **Back it up off the box** (password manager / secrets vault). A database backup is useless
  without the matching key. To recover the auto-generated one if you ever need it:
  `docker compose exec n8n cat /home/node/.n8n/config`.
- **Never "rotate" the key by just editing `.env`** — that's the lose-it-or-change-it failure
  above. Real rotation is a formal, one-way feature (UI: Settings → Data Encryption Keys, behind
  the `N8N_ENV_FEAT_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ROTATION` flag; full DB backup required first; records
  re-encrypt lazily): <https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/security/rotate-encryption-keys>.

## Hardening checklist

Most of these are already baked into the `assets/` templates (marked ✓). The rest are optional
toggles to apply based on the user's needs.

| Setting | Templates | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY` set explicitly | ✓ | Key lives in your secret store, not just a volume |
| `N8N_SECURE_COOKIE=true` + `N8N_PROXY_HOPS=1` + `N8N_PROTOCOL=https` | ✓ | Login cookie only over HTTPS; n8n trusts Caddy's `X-Forwarded-*`. (Get these wrong and secure-cookie can lock you out.) |
| `WEBHOOK_URL` / `N8N_EDITOR_BASE_URL` = the public HTTPS URL | ✓ | Otherwise n8n hands out `http://localhost:5678/...` webhook & OAuth-callback URLs |
| `N8N_DIAGNOSTICS_ENABLED=false` | ✓ | Turns off anonymous telemetry (side effect: also disables the Code node's "Ask AI"). For full outbound isolation (update pings, template fetches) see <https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/basic-configuration/configuration-examples/isolate-n8n> |
| `N8N_BLOCK_ENV_ACCESS_IN_NODE=true` | ✓ | Code-node/expressions can't read `process.env` (your container secrets). Relax only if a workflow genuinely needs an env var. |
| `N8N_DEFAULT_BINARY_DATA_MODE` set explicitly | ✓ | Default keeps binary data **in memory**. Single → `filesystem` (files to disk, not RAM/SQLite). Queue → `database` (filesystem is unsupported in queue mode; S3/Azure need Enterprise) — see `QUEUE_MODE.md` |
| Execution-data pruning (`EXECUTIONS_DATA_PRUNE` + `_MAX_AGE` + `_PRUNE_MAX_COUNT`) | ✓ | Caps disk/DB growth and how long run data (which can contain PII) is retained |
| Internal ports never published (5678/5432/6379) | ✓ | Only Caddy is internet-facing |
| `N8N_ENFORCE_SETTINGS_FILE_PERMISSIONS=true` | optional | Forces `0600` on the settings file in `~/.n8n` (default `false`) |
| `N8N_RUNNERS_ENABLED=true` | ✓ | Moves Code-node execution into a task runner (no-op on n8n ≥ 2.0, where runners are always on). The default **internal** mode is a child process of n8n with the same user and access, which is not isolation. The docs reserve it for instances without sensitive data. Real isolation is an **external** `n8nio/runners` sidecar (`N8N_RUNNERS_MODE=external`), which is also the only way Python Code nodes run on the stock image. Setup, queue-mode pairing and verification: `TASK_RUNNERS.md`. Hardening: <https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/security/harden-task-runners> |
| Code-node module allowlists left at defaults | ✓ | JS: `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_BUILTIN` / `NODE_FUNCTION_ALLOW_EXTERNAL`. Python: `N8N_RUNNERS_STDLIB_ALLOW` / `N8N_RUNNERS_EXTERNAL_ALLOW`, empty by default, so even `import json` is rejected. Allow specific modules only, never `*` on a multi-user box (Python `*` includes `os`/`subprocess`/`socket`). In internal mode they are env vars on n8n. **In external mode they are `env-overrides` in the sidecar's `/etc/n8n-task-runners.json`**, not container env vars. See `TASK_RUNNERS.md`: <https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/basic-configuration/configuration-examples/enable-modules-in-code-node> |
| `N8N_SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED=true` | optional | Off by default (newer n8n only). Stops HTTP-type nodes from reaching loopback/private/link-local ranges — i.e. Docker-network neighbors like `postgres:5432` and cloud metadata IPs. Enable on multi-user boxes; allowlist genuinely-needed internal hosts via `N8N_SSRF_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES`/`_ALLOWED_IP_RANGES`: <https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/security/enable-ssrf-protection> |
| `NODES_EXCLUDE` | optional | Execute Command is already blocked by default (setting `NODES_EXCLUDE=[]` would *re-enable* it). To block more, JSON-array syntax: `NODES_EXCLUDE=["n8n-nodes-base.readWriteFile"]` — <https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/security/block-specific-nodes> |
| `N8N_PUBLIC_API_DISABLED=true` | optional | Turn the public REST API off if unused (commented in the single template); pair with `N8N_PUBLIC_API_SWAGGERUI_DISABLED=true` to also drop the API playground |
| OS firewall: only 22/80/443 | apply in step 5 | `ufw allow OpenSSH && ufw allow 80 && ufw allow 443 && ufw enable` |
| Owner account + 2FA | hand-off | Whoever completes the owner-setup form first claims the instance — do it before sharing the URL. Enable 2FA (per-user 2FA is free; org-wide *enforcement* via `N8N_MFA_ENFORCED_ENABLED` needs a paid plan). Automated deploys can pre-provision the owner by env (n8n ≥ 2.17: `N8N_INSTANCE_OWNER_MANAGED_BY_ENV` + email + bcrypt password hash): <https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/user-management> |
| SMTP (`N8N_EMAIL_MODE=smtp` + `N8N_SMTP_*`) | multi-user | Without SMTP, invite links must be copied manually and users **cannot self-serve password resets**: <https://docs.n8n.io/deploy/host-n8n/configure-n8n/basic-configuration/use-environment-variables/user-management-and-2fa> |
| `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT_AUTH_TOKEN` set (if using overwrites) | `CREDENTIAL_OVERWRITES.md` | Only if you enable `CREDENTIALS_OVERWRITE_ENDPOINT`. With an empty token n8n installs no auth middleware and the route accepts the **first** POST from anyone, then latches — whoever gets there first owns the OAuth app your users consent to. |
| Keep host + image updated | `DAY2.md` | Patch the OS; update the n8n image deliberately |

## Don't-leak rules (client safety)

- **Fresh secrets per box** — never carry an encryption key, DB password, or `.env` from one
  client's instance to another.
- **No secrets in committed files** — `.env` only (600), referenced as `${VAR}`. Scan any file
  you're about to commit: it must contain zero real keys, tokens, passwords, or client domains.
- **Redact when inspecting** — when reading a `.env` to debug, mask values
  (`sed -E 's/=.*/=<redacted>/'`); never paste raw secret values into chat or logs.
- **The Caddyfile and compose templates are domain-free** (the domain comes from `.env`), so
  they're safe to keep in version control; a `.env` is not.
